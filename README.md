# PicTraceV2üîç

_**PicTraceV2**_ is a highly efficient image matching platform that leverages computer vision using _**OpenCV**_, deep learning with _**TensorFlow**_ and the _**ResNet50 model**_, asynchronous processing with _**aiohttp**_, and the _**FastAPI**_ web framework for rapid and accurate image search. PicTraceV2 allows users to upload images directly or provide URLs, quickly scanning a vast database to find similar images. Asynchronous processing ensures smooth and fast visual search, enhancing the user experience.
